# Neovim (btw)

This is my relatively up-to-date neovim configuration. 
I use it for all sorts of programming and writing tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to `~/.config/nvim` or symlink it there. 
2. Open neovim and allow the configuration to install via LazyVim.
3. Restart neovim and enjoy.

## Notes

### Leader mapping

I use the spacebar as my leader key.
This is my personal preference, and easily changed in `lua/config/lazy.lua` on line 21.

### Keymaps

The keymap is centralized for the most part in `lua/config/keymap.lua`.
